        <p class="project__desc">
            "Face to Meet You" delves into the intricate layers of 'face'—not merely as a physical representation of oneself but as a metaphorical mask reflecting respectability, social standing, and personal battles. The project draws from diverse cultural interpretations, particularly the Chinese concept of 面子 (miànzi), to explore the performative dimensions of social interactions as framed by Social Exchange Theory. Projected onto life-sized acrylic nesting dolls (a nod to Anastasia's Russian heritage) visitors see anxiety, anger, sadness, and a whimsical self hidden behind a polite facade.
