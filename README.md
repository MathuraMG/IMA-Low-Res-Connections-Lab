# Connections Lab
The contents of this repo are used in service of a course titled "Connections Lab" class which ran in the NYU's Master of Arts [IMA Low Res Pogram](https://itp.nyu.edu/lowres/) 2020-21 Fall semester.

## Course Description
From intelligent chat-bots and gif-sharing apps to social media platforms and virtual reality hubs, our world is infused with mediated networked systems for communication. In this course, students will collaborate (at a distance) to design and develop their own creative connected web applications. By working in teams to produce online experiences that bring people together in playful yet meaningful ways, students will gain valuable insight into the inner-workings and implications of our connected world.

## Course Instructors
* Mathura Govindarajan (mathura.mg@nyu.edu)
* Craig Protzel (craig.protzel@nyu.edu)
* Ruta Kruliauskaite (ruta@nyu.edu)

## Course Structure
* **Module 1 - Talking to the Web:** In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of client-side web development and we will explore how to use data from the web to produce creative stories and user interactions.
* **Module 2 - Talking to Each Other:** In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of server-side web development with a focus on technologies that allow for real-time multi-person communication and participatory experiences.
* **Module 3 - Talking++ (Stop Talking, Start Listening):** In this module, we will focus on project building, play-testing, and user experience all directed towards a final project.
